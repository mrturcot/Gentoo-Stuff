My Gentoo / Linux Stuff

 - mpv: my mpv.conf with a few nice scripts gathered eg. "right click context menu"
 - portage: dir with key gentoo configs && a clang-lto-env (per-package) setup
 - rip: :( *we dont talk about that*
 - scripts: git-repo check/pull/build & auto full gentoo upgrade & other handy things 
 - stuff: random linux config files
