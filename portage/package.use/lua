### The LUA_TARGETS variable is used for packages that support enabling more than a single LUA implementation. Therefore, the variable may contain any number of implementations. ###
*/* LUA_TARGETS: luajit lua5-4 -lua5-3 -lua5-1

### The LUA_SINGLE_TARGET variable is used for packages that are built for a single implementation of choice only. It may contain only a single implementation. Due to technical limitations, the implementation specified as LUA_SINGLE_TARGET must also be included in LUA_TARGETS for the package in question.
*/* LUA_SINGLE_TARGET: luajit

# package only supports single target
dev-lua/luv LUA_SINGLE_TARGET: -* luajit
net-analyzer/nmap LUA_SINGLE_TARGET: -lua5-3
