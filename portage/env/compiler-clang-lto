## For full LTO, replace -flto=thin with -flto in the following examples. 
## There should be no compatibility differences between full LTO and thin LTO.
## Additionally, if Clang was not built with the default-lld USE flag,
## add the -fuse-ld=lld value to the following LDFLAGS. 

# Enable clang-lto
CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -flto=thin"
CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS} -flto=thin"
# -O2 in LDFLAGS refers to binary size optimization during linking, it is NOT related to the -O levels of the compiler          
LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -Wl,-O2 -Wl,--as-needed"
